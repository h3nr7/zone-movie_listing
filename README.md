# ZONE MOVING LISTING

This app is built with a custom stack of React and Node.  The UI is based heavily on Material-UI.

There are mainly 2 filtering functions fromt the sidebar with rating and genre.  The type of genre filter can be either union or intersection, where movies would either contain some of the keyword types or all.

It is not completely responsive however do scale and keeps its integrity visually.
